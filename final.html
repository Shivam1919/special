                I wanted to take a moment to express just how deeply grateful I am for you. For your love, your kindness, your laughter, and the way you light up every moment we share. Every day with you feels like a gift, and I’m so thankful that I get to call you mine.
                
                You make even the smallest moments feel special. Whether we’re having deep conversations, sharing silly inside jokes, or simply sitting together in silence, I cherish every second. Your presence brings me peace and joy, and your heart has given me a sense of belonging and love that I never knew I needed.
                
                On this Thanksgiving, I want to thank you for being the incredible woman that you are—for your patience, your support, your unwavering belief in us, and for just being you. I am beyond lucky to walk through life with you by my side. I can’t wait to see all the beautiful moments we’ll create in the years ahead.
                
                I love you more than words can express, and I am so thankful for you—not just today, but every single day.
                
                With all my love,
                </h2>
